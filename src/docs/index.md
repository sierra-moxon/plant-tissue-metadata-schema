**A DOE Office of Science User Facility Initiative**

## Overview

The Plant Tissue Metadata Schema is a LinkML-based standardized schema for capturing comprehensive metadata about plant tissue samples. This schema supports the Joint Genome Institute's mission to **lead genomic innovation for a sustainable bioeconomy** by enabling reproducible, interoperable plant genomics research.

## JGI Context

This schema aligns with the JGI 2024 Strategic Plan's focus on:

- **Nutrient Cycling**: Understanding biological drivers of carbon and biogeochemical cycles
- **Functional Diversity**: Characterizing functional traits across plant species in DOE-relevant ecosystems  
- **Data and Connectivity**: Providing standardized, high-quality data for AI/ML applications
- **Stewarding Resources**: Supporting the global research community with professional expertise

By standardizing plant tissue metadata collection, this schema enables researchers to contribute to transformative research addressing environmental and energy challenges in support of a sustainable bioeconomy.
